# Software Quality by Example

Within the software verification and validation process, there are two complementary approaches to system checking and analysis:
* **[Software inspections](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwarequality/tree/master/Inspection)** 
or peer reviews analyze and check system representations such as the requirements document, design diagrams and the program source code. Software inspection is a static verification and validation technique.
* **[Software testing](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-softwarequality/tree/master/Testing)** 
involves running an implementation of the software with test data. We examine the outputs of the software and its operational behavior to check that it is performing as required. Testing is a dynamic technique of verification and validation. 

This project collects examples for the first two categories. Examples for GUI Tests can be found in

As a development environment, you can use a pre-configured Linux VM image:
