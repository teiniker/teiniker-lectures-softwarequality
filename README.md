# Software Quality by Examples

Following the Agile Testing approach, we can have to implement the following tests in each iteration:
* Q1: Unit Tests
* Q2: Functional Tests
* Q3: GUI Tests
* Q3: Non-Functional Tests

This project collects examples for the first two categories. Examples for GUI Tests can be found in

As a development environment, you can use a pre-configured Linux VM image:
